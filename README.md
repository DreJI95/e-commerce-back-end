  # Description
     This project contains the back end for an e-commerce site. I utilized Express.js APIs to configure and interact with the database using the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methodology.

  # Installation 
     1) After cloning the code base enter the "npm install command". 2) Run the "mysql -u root -p" command. 3) Enter "source db/schema.sql" to build the database. 4) Then exit to the git bash and enter the command "node seeds/index.js. 5) Lastly enter npm start to start running the server. 6) You will need an API endpoint tool to interact with differect CRUD commands.
